    <h2>Then and Now</h2>
    According to the website Britannica,
    <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/art/horror-story">
      <p>
      The genre was invented by Horace Walpole, whose Castle of Otranto (1765) may be said to have founded the horror story as a legitimate literary form.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus, 1765 is the year that paved way for a beloved genre. Since then the genre has been adapted and given life by many authors such as <span class="author">Edgar Allen Poe,</span>, <span class="author">Stephen King</span>, <span class="author">Ann Rice</span>. And with a great novel comes movie adaptations and new films inspired by those same adaptations. Some of the best horror movies to come out that keep you in suspense and shock are: Hereditary,Us, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Identity. </p>
